    <h1>About Nathan Gabriel</h1>
  </section>
  <section class="about-content">
    <p>Hello! I'm Nathan Gabriel — a passionate, full-time musician based in Sunbury, Victoria. My life revolves around performing, producing, and living through music. Whether I'm busking in town, performing at private events, or composing solo projects, music is my voice and my vessel.</p>

    <p>I've released two full-length solo albums independently, with more music always on the horizon. My performances aim to connect, uplift, and leave a lasting impression. I love blending old-school songwriting with contemporary storytelling, and I’m inspired every day by people, love, and real-life moments.</p>

    <p>Outside of music, I'm a lover of gaming, films, and animals — especially my cat. I believe in being real, kind, and constantly evolving. Thanks for being here and joining me on this journey.</p>
