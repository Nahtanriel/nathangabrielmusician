This week was all about learning. Throughout the week, I found myself gravitating towards the game development category. Working with Unreal Engine, I was building lots of testing levels, where I would play around with new concepts and ideas I was building for a future game project. About 15 years ago I was extremely interested in game engines, specifically Unreal Engine. And coming back to it after such a hiatus, lots of the core engine capabilities have been expanded, or outright removed. I started to understand increasingly about certain concepts, variables, Boolean, float, vectors you name it.  
  
It began to become increasingly difficult as time went on, due to the overwhelming nature of everything I was trying to accomplish. So, I began to create scenarios in which I could implement smaller things, and comprehend them on a deeper level, whilst maintaining forward momentum, as I was getting quite a lot of roadblocks. I needed a *WIN.*  
As the week went on, I had to reinvent how I was learning, making myself understand that it’s okay to just learn, and not have everything absorbed in a week. *(Wait, why noooot?!).*  
  
I found projects that were already developed and started to dissect them and try and understand how each works. A great thing about Unreal Engine is its abundance of resources to anyone interested. They have Content Example projects showcasing each of its capabilities. As the first week has gone by since making the new change and creation of Nahtanriel, I think I’ve succeeded. I can now have a character run from one side of the screen to another, and the floor underneath them loads in, destroys itself as it passes the character, and repeats. INFINITE TREADMILL. *(Poor Fella)*  
  
Throughout the entirety of this, I had my electric guitar in hand and would be *noodling* on it. The process right now is learning; I was able to determine how to best incorporate economy picking, with alternate picking. KNOWLEDGE OVER 9000!
